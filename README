This directory contains bits needed to test a docker container running web2py from the Debian package (wheezy) using Apache and WSGI.

This is not meant for production and run it at your own risk only.

Note that this is not using latest upstream web2py but the version packaged in Debian (wheezy).

Building
--------
 $ docker build -t debian-web2py .

Testing
-------
 $ docker run -d -p 8080:80 -p 8443:443 debian-web2py

Connect on http://localhost:8080/ or https://localhost:8443/

The admin password is as set in the Dockerfile.

Debugging a failed container :
 $ docker exec -t -i [CONTAINER_ID] /bin/bash
